   <p> Cats are clearly the best pets. They are furry and soft and loveable. You can play with them with low effort. They mostly take care of themselves all you have to do is feed them</p>

   <p> Unlike dogs cats are a lot less work you don't have to take them out for walks, and they got to the bathroom on their own. A nother good thing about cats is that they are much quiter than dogs and won't wake you up with barking.</p>

   <p>Dogs are the best pet becuase they love to interact with people and get their attention.
   Unlike cats who will ignore you half the time. Dogs also keep you fit by going on walks. As well you can throw a ball for them or just let them chase you.</p>

   <p>Dogs aren't just good for being loveable pets though, they can be trained for contests like obstacle courses. They can also be trained to help you hunt or can be a reliable guard dog to scare of intruders.
