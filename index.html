   <p>Dogs are the best pet becuase they love to interact with people and get their attention.
   Unlike cats who will ignore you half the time. Dogs also keep you fit by going on walks. As well you can throw a ball for them or just let them chase you.</p>

   <p>Dogs aren't just good for being loveable pets though, they can be trained for contests like obstacle courses. They can also be trained to help you hunt or can be a reliable guard dog to scare of intruders.
