   <p> Cats are clearly the best pets. They are furry and soft and loveable. You can play with them with low effort. They mostly take care of themselves all you have to do is feed them</p>

   <p> Unlike dogs cats are a lot less work you don't have to take them out for walks, and they got to the bathroom on their own. A nother good thing about cats is that they are much quiter than dogs and won't wake you up with barking.
